  # unit tests for get_monitoring_breakdown
  # Get Monitoring Breakdown
  # Gets breakdown information for a specific dimension and metric along with the number of concurrent viewers and negative impact score.
  # @param monitoring_metric_id ID of the Monitoring Metric
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :dimension Dimension the specified value belongs to
  # @option opts [Integer] :timestamp Timestamp to limit results by. This value must be provided as a unix timestamp. Defaults to the current unix timestamp.
  # @option opts [Array<String>] :filters Limit the results to rows that match conditions from provided key:value pairs. Must be provided as an array query string parameter.  To exclude rows that match a certain condition, prepend a &#x60;!&#x60; character to the dimension.  Possible filter names are the same as returned by the List Filters endpoint.  Example:    * &#x60;filters[]&#x3D;operating_system:windows&amp;filters[]&#x3D;!country:US&#x60; 
  # @option opts [String] :order_by Value to order the results by
  # @option opts [String] :order_direction Sort order.
